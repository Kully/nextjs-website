The [<u>Interventions Dashboard</u>](https://intervention-model.herokuapp.com/) is an MVP we put together for Google in 2020. Under tight time constraints (3-4 weeks), we managed to complete our objective: successfully reproduce an R-Shiny dashboard, strictly using the tools of Plotly and Dash!

This Web App is coded in Python and is leveraging both the open-source [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) library and the [Dash Design Kit](https://plotly.com/dash/design-kit/), Plotly‚Äôs Enterprise solution.

The original app, which is part of a broader project consisting of many dashboards and predictive models, focuses on _‚Äú[USA] state and county-level insight into the dynamics of COVID-19 regarding hospital capacity, PPE, and non-pharmaceutical interventions‚Äù_ [1]. Due to our scope and rapid development time, we agreed to only use mock data and limit user selection to only 3 states: California, New York, and Washington.

And after many long days, a couple feedback sessions with the team, and one "memorable" all-nighter, it was complete! üôå
